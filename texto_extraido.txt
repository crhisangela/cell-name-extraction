published as an advance article on the web 26th april 2002 methylene blue (mb+) is a sensitizer that has been used for a variety of applications including energy conversion and photodynamic therapy (pdt). although its photochemical properties in isotropic solution are well established, its eﬀect in vivo and in restricted reaction environments is somewhat erratic. in order to understand its photochemical behavior when it interacts with biomolecules, in particular with membranes, mb+ properties were studied in sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (ctab) solutions. because of an electrostatic attraction, sds and mb+ form complexes, changing the properties of both the micelles and the mb+ solutions. surface tension measurements show that the c.m.c. of sds decreases from (cid:1)7 mm to (cid:1)70 mm when the mb+ concentration increases from 0 to 45 mm. above the c.m.c., binding of mb+ in the micelle pseudo-phase causes the formation of aggregates (mostly dimers) as attested by the increase in the absorption at 580 nm and the decrease in ﬂuorescence emission. the extent of dimer formation is dependent on the relative concentrations of mb+ and sds. in the presence of excess of sds, mb+ is mainly in the monomer form and at low sds concentration dimers are favored. such eﬀect, which was not observed in ctab micelles, was modeled qualitatively by considering that mb+ molecules partition to the micelle pseudo- phase which favors or disfavors dimers as a function of its volume. mb+ transient species were characterized by laser ﬂash photolysis and nir emission showing the presence of triplets and subsequently singlet oxygen at high sds concentration and semi-reduced and semi-oxidized mb+ radicals at low sds concentration. therefore it was shown that, depending on the ground state mb+ monomer/dimer equilibrium, induced by the micelles, the photochemical properties of mb+ can be shifted from a type ii (energy transfer to oxygen forming singlet oxygen) to a type i mechanism (electron transfer forming the semi-reduced and the semi-oxidized radicals of mb+). introduction sensitization processes are extremely important in several areas including biology, chemistry and medicine.1 fundamen- living organisms such as photosynthesis tal processes of depend on light absorption and subsequent photophysical and photochemical processes.2 the application of sensitization to medicine has become extremely important, specially in the new method of cancer treatment known as photodynamic ther- apy (pdt), where photoinduced in situ generation of reactive species has been used to induce tumor regression.3 in both mentioned cases, processes of energy and/or electron transfer are involved and the knowledge of how these processes are aﬀected/modulated by biological environments (membranes, proteins) is important.1–4 the mechanisms of tumoral destruction involve direct oxi- dation (mechanisms type i) of biological targets (membranes, proteins and dna), as well as oxidation mediated by singlet oxygen (1o2) (mechanisms type ii), which is mainly formed through energy transfer from triplets to molecular oxygen.5 binding of molecules in membranes and interfaces can cause several alterations in their ground state properties (dimeriza- tion and/or ion-pair equilibria) and consequently in the photo- physical and photochemical processes in which they are involved.6,7 the details of these processes need to be further investigated for the case of sensitizers used in photodynamic therapy, in which the photodynamic eﬀect will happen in cells or tissues, where the photosensitizers will be interacting with macromolecules or membranes.7,8 adsorption of dyes into oppositely charged interfaces, for instance, micelles or polyelectrolytes, has been extensively stu- died.9–13 depending on the charge ratio between the dyes and the charged groups in the colloid interface, dye aggregates are favored.9,10 this ﬁeld of dye–surfactant interaction is of great relevance to the dyeing and photography industry.11 however, there has been little eﬀort towards proposing equilibrium schemes to model dimerization in micelle solution.10 the eﬀect of the dye on the micellization properties of surfactants has also been studied to a lesser extent.12,13 guo and coworkers have used long-chain dyes which themselves act as surfactants. their results were interpreted in terms of the lange and beck theory that proposes an ideal mixture between surfactants. deviations from ideality were observed when the long-chain dyes and surfactants have opposite charges.12 microheterogeneous systems are known to promote diﬀeren- tial distribution of substrates, intermediates and products, in the organic, aqueous or interfacial regions, which can usually be explained by a combination of electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic eﬀect.1,2,14 due to these eﬀects, interesting changes in photochemical processes have been observed in micelles, reversed micelles, microemulsions and vesicle systems, including yield enhancements,14,15 variation of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity,16,17 change in mechanisms,18–20 enhanced eﬀects23 and increased charge separation,21,22 magnetic 2320 phys. chem. chem. phys., 2002, 4, 2320–2328 doi: 10.1039/b109753a this journal is # the owner societies 2002

bimolecular processes is extensive. the relative importance of type i and type ii photosensiti- zation reactions and the subsequent damage of biological tar- gets is a recurrent topic in the photochemical literature.7,8,29–31 it has been shown that the binding of positively charged sensi- tizers to protein may favor type i processes because of several factors, including more rigid environment, protection of tri- plets from oxygen suppression, facilitating protein–sensitizer electron transfer reactions and formation of sensitizer aggre- gates induced by the protein hydrophobic pockets.7,8,30,31 most studies with membranes have emphasized the increase in type ii reactions subsequent to the sensitizer binding in the membrane, due to the decrease in dimerization of the sen- (usually porphyrin and phthalocyanine) and the sitizers increased oxygen concentration in the less polar media, thereby resulting in an increase in the 1o2 yield.24–28 methylene blue (mb+, scheme 1) is a sensitizer that has been used in vitro for a variety of applications including energy conversion and photodynamic therapy. it is especially useful due generation (fd (cid:1) 0.5),32 making it valuable for in vitro photoxygenation of biological materials or organic precursors.33–37 to the high quantum yield of 1o2 its photoinduced eﬀect in cell culture or in vivo is somewhat erratic.38–41 there are unexplained reports of mb+ being inac- tive photochemically.38–40 also the photodynamic eﬃciency of phenothiazine dyes has been shown to be dependent on the solution ph40 as well as the octanol/water partition coeﬃcient of the ground state molecule, that changes its aﬃnity to pro- tein, membranes or dna targets.41 in general, the photoche- mical mechanism and eﬃciency seem to be dependent on the location of the sensitizer, which can alter its ground state and excited state properties.38–41 in order to mimic its photo- chemical behavior when it interacts with biological samples, in particular with membranes, mb+ ground state and excited state properties have been studied in sds and ctab solu- tions. due mainly to an electrostatic interaction, sds and mb+ form complexes that change the properties of both the micelle and the mb+ solution equilibria. depending on the surfactant/dye molar ratio mb+ dimers are favored, and the photochemistry of mb+ is shifted from a preponderantly singlet oxygen to a mainly radical generator, without addition of any other photoactive or redox agent. materials and methods materials mb+ was acquired from aldrich and double recrystallized from ethanol. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco 98%, aldrich), sds and ctab (merck, 99% hplc grade) were used without further puriﬁcation. d2o (99%) was acquired from aldrich. water was bidistilled from an all-glass appara- tus and was further puriﬁed via a millipore milli-q system. all other materials were of the best analytical grade available. all solutions were prepared and used on the same day. to avoid buﬀer eﬀects in the photochemical behavior the measure- ments were performed in milli-q water.37 the solution phs were measured to be within 6.4 (cid:2) 0.3. instruments and methods absorbance spectra were recorded in a shimadzu uv-2400-pc interfaced to a pentium ii and ﬂuorescence spectra were recorded in a spex dm3000-f, using 1 or 0.1 cm optical path length quartz cuvettes. spectral data were further manipulated with a 386 grams software (galatic,inc). laser ﬂash photolysis data were obtained with an applied photophysics system composed of a nd:yag laser (spectron laser system, england) operating at 532 nm delivering pulses with (cid:1)30 mj pulse(cid:3)1 and (cid:1)10 ns (fwhm) and a pulsed 150 w xe lamp. control electronics and a hewlett packard 54510b digitizing oscilloscope were used for data capture. for the nir emission measurements a homemade cell compartment coupled with a germanium pin detector (eg&judson, model j16d-m204-r05m-wb) was used. transients were stored and analyzed in a 386 pc compatible microcomputer. decays were ﬁtted to single or double exponentials using the software ori- gin (microcal). the 1o2 decay experiments were performed in d2o to increase the 1o2 lifetime. no changes in ﬂuorescence and absorbance properties of mb+ as a function of sds con- centration were observed comparing experiments performed in water and in d2o. surface tension measurements were performed by the ring method42 by using a de nou¨ y tensiometer (fisher scientiﬁc tensiomat, mode 21 1993). the c.m.c. were determined by using surface tension x ln [sds] curves. excess functions were calculated by using eqn.

(5–10 times) one can interpret the results as the mb+ interacting with micelles. the knowledge gained studying the physical-chemis- try properties of sds/mb+ solutions can now be used to interpret the photophysical and photochemical results. 2322 phys. chem. chem. phys., 2002, 4, 2320–2328 eﬀect of sds on the mb+ solution equilibria mb+ monomers and dimers have been characterized before and they have distinct absorbance spectra.43,44 as can be observed in fig. 2, monomers have a maximum at 665 nm and dimers at 580 nm. note that by changing the sds concen- tration the mb+ absorbance spectra changes considerably. at low sds concentration (1 mm) there is an increase in the absorption intensity at around 580 nm, while at high sds con- centration (50 mm), an increase at 665 nm is observed and the spectrum is almost the same as that of pure mb+ monomer. the diﬀerence in absorption between monomers and dimers facilitates the calculation of the concentration of each species present in solution. furthermore, the ratio of the absorbance at 580 and 665 nm (a580/a665) gives a qualitative estimate of the relative concentration of dimers to monomers. the absorption spectra of an 8 mm mb+ solution was mea- sured as a function of sds and ctab concentrations and the a580/a665 values were calculated. (fig. 3) it can be noticed that a580/a665 increases as a function of sds concentration up to (cid:1)3 mm and then starts to decrease. the increase in a580/ a665 indicates the increase in the concentration of dimers in relation to monomers. the dimer formation can also be veri- ﬁed by measuring the ﬂuorescence intensity (fig. 3, inset). as the a580/a665 increases the emission intensity divided by the fraction of light absorbed at the excitation wavelength (if/f580) decreases, indicating the presence of dimers, probably h type dimers, which are not ﬂuorescent and have an increased downloaded by indiana university - purdue university at indianapolis on 03 august 2012published on 26 april 2002 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/b109753aview online because of the small volume of the micelle pseudo-phase under ‘‘ local ’’ mb+ concentration is these conditions, higher induced, and dimer formation is maximized. it is important to notice that the mb+ dimer equilibrium constant was calcu- lated to be 3.8 (cid:5) 103 m(cid:3)1 in water, which is accordance with other published results.43,44 therefore, at 8 mm only 2% mb+ are expected in the dimer form in aqueous solutions, compared with 70–80% of dimers that are observed at certain micelle concentrations. in order to modulate the eﬀect of micelles on the dimeriza- tion equilibria of mb+, a phenomenological model was applied which is aimed to predict qualitatively the variation of monomer and dimer concentrations as a function of deter- gent concentration (scheme 2). because small mb+ concentra- tions are used (micromolar range), the dimerization constant in the aqueous phase was ignored. the equations that describe these equilibria are the mass balance (eqn. (5)), the relation between the ‘‘ local ’’ micelle concentration and the analytical concentration of each of the species involved (eqn. (6)), the partition equilibrium constant (eqn. (7)) and the dimerization constant in the micelle phase (eqn. (8)). note that the partition constant is deﬁned as the ratio of the total mb+ concentration in the micelle pseudo-phase ([mm] + 2[dm]) divided by the total concentration of mb+ in the aqueous phase, which is assumed to be equal to [mw]. ct ¼ ½mw(cid:4) þ ½mm(cid:4) þ 2½dm(cid:4) where ct is the total mb+ concentration, the superscripts m and w indicate the micelle pseudo-phase and aqueous phases, respectively. ð5þ ½xmicelle(cid:4) ¼ ½xanalytical(cid:4) cdv ð5þ where [xanalytical] is the concentration of x calculated by absorption measurements using eqn.

concentration of monomers in the micelle pseudo-phase can be calculated using the dimer concentration (extracted directly from the absorbance spectra) and the calculated dimerization m ¼ 295 m(cid:3)1). therefore, it is possible to calcu- constant (kd late the concentrations of all the species involved in this equili- brium ([mw], [mm], [dm]). by plotting ([mm] + 2[dm])/[mw] as a function of cdv (fig. 4b), the partition constant was cal- culated to be 2.5 (cid:5) 104 m(cid:3)1, which is compatible with the strong sds/mb+ interaction. using these values of the equili- brium constants, the concentrations of mw, mm and dm were calculated as a function of the micellized sds concentration (fig. 4 upper panel). it can be observed that at low sds con- centration the model predicts a decrease in the mw concentra- tion with a consecutive increase in the mm and dm concentrations as the sds concentration increases. while the [mm] increase follows a hyperbolic curve, [dm] reaches a max- imum and starts to decrease as observed experimentally. based on these concentrations the value of the apparent dimerization ap ¼ [dm]/([mw] + [mm])2) was calculated as a constant (kd function of sds concentration. it can be observed that this function also predicts a maximum in the dimerization constant as observed in the experimentally measured a580/a665 curve (fig. 4, lower panel). it can also be noticed that the absorbance data suggest a higher decrease in the dimer concentration as the sds concentration increases than that predicted by the model. the reasons for the lack of agreement at high sds concentra- tions may be the presence of higher order aggregates in the maximum of the dimer concentration region, which are not considered in the present model. modulation of the mb+ photochemical properties by binding to negatively charged micelles mb+ has been extensively used for photo-oxidation of natural and synthetic molecules. two major photochemical pathways are usually observed:29,33–41,47–52 type ii where the triplet energy is transferred to oxygen forming singlet oxygen (1o2) and type i where reducing agents donate an electron to mb+ triplets, forming the semi-reduced radical (mb(cid:6)). at high dye concentration, ground state mb+ molecules can them- selves act as reducing agents (d–3d* mechanism).47 in homo- geneous solution where no dimers are present (in ethanol, for instance) mb+ produces triplets with high quantum yield (ft ¼ 0.52). in the conditions employed in this work, i.e., rela- tively small dye concentration, in the presence of oxygen and in the absence of reducing agents basically only type ii reac- tions are observed, i.e., mb+ works as an eﬃcient 1o2 photo- generator (fd (cid:1) 0.5).29,33,34,51,52 in the presence of sds above the c.m.c., mb+ binds to the micelle and, depending on the ratio of micelle to mb+ concentrations, mb+ aggregates are observed. the photochemical properties of mb+ can then be modulated by binding to the micelle pseudo-phase. the photochemical intermediates following laser pulse exci- tation (nd:yag) at 532 nm were monitored by laser ﬂash photolysis. in the presence of excess of micelles (50 mm of sds) only monomers are present (fig. 2). it can be noticed that the transient spectrum obtained at this condition has a maximum around 420 nm (fig. 5a). this transient has been characterized before and is due to mb+ triplets.49–51 it has a lifetime of around 1.5 ms (fig. 5a, inset), which is the same as the bleaching recovery time measured at 630 nm (fig. 5a, inset). these results obtained in excess sds micelles are com- patible with the main deactivation process of mb+ triplets being controlled by diﬀusional collision with oxygen (air-satu- rated) forming 1o2 (reaction (2), scheme 3, see fig. 7 for results concerning 1o2 sensitization). therefore in sds micelles in the presence of oxygen, mb+ has a photochemical behavior similar to that observed in isotropic solution, i.e., it is an eﬃcient triplet and singlet oxygen generator. the transient spectrum (fig. 5b) of the mb+ solution in the presence of 1 mm of sds (80% of dimers are present), is com- pletely diﬀerent from that observed in the presence of 50 mm fig. 5 da of mb+ solutions containing 50 (a) and 1 (b) mm of sds measured at 0.1 (l), 1 (s), 4 (g), 14 (˘) ms after the laser pulse in a and 0.035

intermediate absorbing at 590 nm. the mb2+(cid:6) lifetime ((cid:1)300 ms) is indepen- dent of the oxygen concentration and it does not react with other oxidizing molecules like methyl viologen (data not shown). additionally, the species absorbing at 590 nm reacts with dabco, a well-known reducing agent, suggesting that it is in an oxidized state. it can be observed that the transient at 590 nm is quenched by dabco with a bimolecular constant of (cid:1)6 (cid:5) 106 m(cid:3)1 s(cid:3)1 (fig. 6c). most of the reported rates for the reaction of dabco with triplets and radical cations are diﬀusion controlled (>109 m(cid:3)1 s(cid:3)1) in isotropic solution.54 for instance, the second order rate constant for the suppres- sion of c60 triplets by dabco is 2.5 (cid:5) 109 m(cid:3)1 cm(cid:3)1 in toluene.55 however, this same reaction is around two orders of magnitude slower in micellar solution.55 our results are in agreement with the smaller suppression eﬃciency of dabco in micellar solution. we may speculate that these small rate constants may be due to a lower diﬀusion rate of dabco in micelles. however, this eﬀect needs to be further investigated. therefore, when sds is added to the mb+ solution at the proper concentration to maximize mb+ dimers in the micelle pseudo-phase, electron transfer processes are facilitated, form- ing mb(cid:6) and mb2+(cid:6) species. this outlined photochemical pathway (scheme 3) indicates that the production of 1o2 should approach zero in the condi- tion that the mb+ monomer/dimer equilibrium is moved to the dimer side in the micelle pseudo-phase (scheme 3). the light emission due to 1o2 (1270 nm) was measured as a func- tion of the sds concentration (fig. 7). with the increase in sds concentration, the 1270 nm emission intensity decreases, approaching a value close to zero at a sds concentration that maximizes dimers (fig. 7). above this concentration, the light emission increases following the decrease of mb+ dimers as the micelle concentration increases. the fact that at high sur- factant concentration the 1o2 emission is larger than the emis- sion observed in water can be explained by the increase in triplet yield formation observed in 50 mm sds micelles when compared to water, as measured by triplet–triplet absorption at 420 nm, as well as by the increased oxygen concentration in the micelle pseudo-phase. 27d this experiment shows that the eﬃciency of 1o2 generation by mb+ can be modulated by the presence of the right amount of sds micelles and mb+ species. conclusion having opposite charges, mb+ and sds form complexes in solution, which change the micelle and the dye properties. the alterations in the micelle and dye equilibria were moni- tored by surface tension and uv–vis/ﬂuorescence measure- ments, respectively. compared with pure sds, sds/mb+ complex has a higher tendency to migrate to the air/water interface and to form micelles at lower sds concentration. an excess of mb+ dimers in relation to monomers was observed at relatively low sds concentration (few millimolar) and only monomers are present at high sds concentrations (above 20–30 times the c.m.c.). the dimerization equilibria in micelle solution can be understood qualitatively by a pseudo- phase type model, which strictly considers the monomer/dimer equilibria in the micelle pseudo-phase. the negatively charged micelle interfaces induce dimer for- mation of positively charged sensitizers and are able to shift a type ii into a type i sensitization mechanism, practically abolishing 1o2 generation. these ﬁndings are of relevance to pdt, where the sensitizer reacts in direct contact with mem- branes, which can vary from the slightly negative cytoplas- matic membranes to the highly negatively charged internal mitochondrial membrane without mentioning the negatively scheme 3 methylene blue photochemical reaction routes where mb+, 1mb+*, 3mb+* are methylene blue ground state, singlet and tri- plet excited states, respectively, mb(cid:6) and mb2+(cid:6) are methylene blue semi-reduced and semi-oxidized radicals, respectively, o1 is light absorption, ff , fnr , ft , are ﬂuorescence, nonradiative and triplet quantum yields. reactions (1)–(4) represent the deactivation routes of mb+ excited state and radical species where (1) is the 3mb+* spon- taneous decay, (2) is the reaction of 3mb+* with molecular oxygen, (3) is the redox suppression of (3mb+(cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:7)mb)* after excitation of ground state dimers, (4) is the oxidation of mb(cid:6) by molecular oxygen returning to the ground state dye and forming superoxide, (5) is the ground state dimerization. the relative position of the excited species presented in this scheme, does not represent their actual energy level. of sds (fig. 5a). a few nanoseconds after the laser pulse, the presence of mb+ triplets (damax ¼ 420 nm) and the semi- reduced radical (mb(cid:6), damax ¼ 530 nm) is noticed.49–51 the absorption due to the triplet disappears on the nanosecond time scale (t (cid:1) 40 ns) (fig. 5b, inset), which is much faster than the lifetime measured in excess sds (fig. 5a, inset). at 200 ns after the pulse only mb(cid:6) species are observed (fig. 5b). there may be two sources of mb(cid:6) species, i.e., from singlet or triplet states after the ground state dimer is excited. in our experiment basically only ground state dimers are being excited (at 532 nm, e of the dimer is 3 times as high as that of the monomer and the dimers are in excess 4 to 1). considering the intense da measured at 420 nm, which is due to triplets, and the fact that the exciton coupling theory predicts that dimers could have increased intersystem crossing,53 it is likely that the main mechanism of electron transfer is the dye–dye mechanism through triplets,47 i.e., reaction (3) of scheme 3. the transient spectra of 3mb+ observed after exciting ground state mono- mers or dimers are not distinguishable, at least in our instru- mental time resolution (tenths of a nanosecond). this eﬀect may be the result of dimer dissociation in the excited state, although it needs further investigation. mb(cid:6) decays with a life- time of (cid:1)1.6 ms, which is also compatible with a deactivation mechanism by oxygen forming the anion superoxide (reaction (4), scheme 3). further evidence for this mechanism can be obtained by per- forming the experiment in the absence of oxygen. it is possible to observe that the fast transient at 420 nm is independent of oxygen concentration, which is compatible with a fast deacti- vation by electron transfer (fig. 6a). the opposite eﬀect is observed for the transient at 530 nm, i.e., it’s lifetime is 4 times shorter in an air-equilibrated sample than in a nitrogen purged one (fig. 6b, t increases from 2 to 8 ms by purging the sample with nitrogen), in agreement with the mechanism of suppres- sion by oxygen as in reaction (4) (scheme 3). because the suppression of mb(cid:6) by oxygen in air-equili- brated solution is an eﬃcient process, it does not allow quan- titative back electron transfer between the redox pair formed (mb2+(cid:6) and mb(cid:6)). the spectral ﬁngerprint of the mb2+(cid:6) 2326 phys. chem. chem. phys., 2002, 4, 2320–2328 downloaded by indiana university - purdue university at indianapolis on 03 august 2012published on 26 april 2002 on
