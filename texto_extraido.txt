the latter is associated with ligand dissociation. cytotoxicity data with hela cells reveals that complex 3 exhibits a greater photocytoxicity index, 1,110, than do either 1 and 2, indicating that the dual action complex is more photoactive towards cells in spite of its low ligand exchange quantum yield. †these authors contributed equally to this work. *corresponding authors. e-mail turro.1@osu.edu (c.t.);

bpy = 2,2´-bipyridine, dppn = benzo[i]dipyrido[3,2-a;2´,3´-c]-phenazine) whose structures are schematically depicted in figure 1.24 upon irradiation with visible light, complex 1 produces 1o2 with φ = 0.88 from a long-lived dppn 3ππ* excited state, and efficiently photocleaves dna, but is not reactive towards the dna duplexes in the dark. moreover, complexes with extended π- systems have been shown to exhibit strong intercalative binding to dna.25-27 2 acs paragon plus environment page 3 of 19 journal of the american chemical society 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 in addition to intercalation, inorganic complexes are also able to bind covalently to dna by attachment of the metal center. such metal nucleobase coordination represents a key feature of the mechanism of action of cisplatin, one of the current leading anticancer drugs.8,9 transition metal complexes with photolabile ligands are able to covalently bind to dna in a manner similar to cisplatin, but only upon irradiation with visible light. the requirement of the use of photons for their activation results in increased spatiotemporal selectivity towards tumor tissue relative to traditional drugs.14,15 moreover, transition metal complexes that are activated by light have been shown to be less toxic in the dark and to exhibit a greater increase in cytotoxicity upon irradiation than the organic compounds currently approved for pct.16,28-31 one such complex, cis-[ru(bpy)2(ch3cn)2]2+ (2, figure 1), exhibits a relatively high quantum yield for ligand exchange with water to yield [ru(bpy)2(h2o)2]2+ (φ400 = 0.21), a value that is significantly greater than for related ru(ii) complexes.16,32,33 ultrafast experiments previously showed that 2 violates kasha's rule though simultaneous population of both its short-lived 3mlct state, τ = 51 ps, and the 3lf (ligand-field) states, and the latter results in fast ligand exchange in water.28 the high quantum yields for exchange of the nitrile ligands in 2 and its ability to simultaneously populate two different upon excitation through ultrafast interystem crossing, together with the efficient sensitization of 1o2 by 1, provides a platform for the possible combination of the two features to generate a new pct agent figure 1. schematic representation of the molecular structures of 1–3. 3 acs paragon plus environment journal of the american chemical society page 4 of 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 that may simultaneously act via two different mechanisms, the production of 1o2 and covalent binding to dna upon irradiation, while remaining inactive in the dark. to this end, the tris- heteroleptic complex [ru(bpy)(dppn)(ch3cn)2]2+ (3) was synthesized and its photophysical properties and phototoxicity were compared to those of 1 and 2 (figure 1). experimental section materials. standard schlenk-line techniques (n2 atmosphere) were used to maintain anaerobic conditions during the preparation of the compounds. the solvents used were of reagent grade quality. normal butanol (n-buoh, mallinckrodt), water (chromar®, mallinckrodt) and acetonitrile (emd chemicals) were used as received. the reagents rucl3•3h2o (pressure chemicals), 2,2´-bipyridine (alfa aesar), potassium ferrioxalate (strem chemicals), 1,3- diphenylisobenzofuran (dpbf, sigma aldrich), and nh4pf6 (sigma aldrich) were purchased and used without further purification. the compounds [ru(bpy)2(dppn)][pf6]2 (1),34 cis- [ru(bpy)2(ncch3)2][pf6]2 (2),28 [(η6-c6h6)rucl(bpy)][cl],35 ru(bpy)(dmso)2cl2, 36 and the dppn ligand37 were prepared according to literature procedures.

spectrum of 3 in h2o as a function of irradiation time are shown in figure 4. a red shift is observed in the spectrum at early times with the appearance of new features with maxima at ~470 nm and ~540 nm (figure 4). over a longer photolysis period, the ~470 nm peak begins to decrease in intensity with concomitant growth of a band with a maximum at 547 nm. overall, a final shift in the mlct absorption maximum from 430 nm to 547 nm is observed; the latter is consistent with the formation of the product [ru(bpy)(dppn)(h2o)2]2+. this shift in energy (4,737 cm–1) upon forming the bis-aqua species is similar to that in 2 (3,121 cm–1) and other related ru(ii) complexes in which two ch3cn ligands are replaced by two water molecules.28,45 no changes in the electronic absorption spectrum of 3 are observed when the complex is stored in the dark in water under similar experimental conditions (figure s5 and s6). the quantum yield for the first ligand exchange, φex, for 3 in h2o to form cis- [ru(bpy)(dppn)(ch3cn)(h2o)]2+ was measured to be 0.002(3) with λirr = 400 nm, a value that is two orders of magnitude lower than that measured for 2, φex = 0.21, to form [ru(bpy)2(ch3cn)(h2o)]2+ under similar irradiation conditions.16c the population of the dissociative 3lf state(s) with ru–ch3cn(σ* character), either directly from the 1mlct state or due to thermal population from the 3mlct state, is required for ligand dissociation to take place (figure 3b).46-49 the low-lying 3ππ* state in 3, which is not present in 2, results in fast 3mlct– 3lf internal conversion (ic, τ ~ 0.7 ps), such that thermal population of the higher-lying 3lf state from the 3mlct does not favorably compete with ic. in addition, the isc from the 1mlct state in 3 is partitioned between the three available triplet states, 3lf, 3mlct, and 3ππ* (figure 3b), instead of only two states in 2, 3lf and 3mlct. the presence of an additional low-lying 3ππ* state reduces the population of the 3lf state and, therefore, quantum yield of ligand dissociation. the long lifetime of the 3ππ* excited state of 3 is expected to result in the sensitization of 1o2. the quantum yield for the generation of 1o2, φ∆, by 3 was measured to be 0.72(2) (λirr = 460 nm) using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (dpbf) as a trapping agent and [ru(bpy)3]2+ as a 12 acs paragon plus environment page 13 of 19 journal of the american chemical

with half maximal inhibitory concentration, ic50 dark, of 334 µm, followed by 2 (ic50 dark = 244 µm) then 1 (ic50 dark = 110 µm). it should be noted that the phototoxic enhancement of 2 towards hela cells under the present experimental conditions is modest (table 1). a similar result was published recently using the pc3 cell line for the same complex.50 in contrast, both 1 and 3 exhibit enhanced cytotoxicities upon irradiation with visible light (466 nm ± 20 nm), followed by incubation for 48 hours in the dark, resulting in ic50 irr values of 390 nm and 470 nm, respectively. although the photocytotoxicity of 3 is slightly lower than that of 1, the important factor in photochemotherapy is the relative toxicity when the complex is kept in dark and when it is irradiated, given by the photocytoxicity index (pi), where pi = (ic50 dark)/(ic50 irr). the pi value for 3 is 2.5-fold greater than that for 1, and represents the effective pct activity of the complex.51 the pi for complexes 1 and 3 are 282 and 711, respectively, but 1 exhibits a greater absorption of the excitation wavelength, which appears as the ra value in table 1 (ra = relative molar extinction coefficient at 466 nm). it should be noted that the percent cellular uptake of 1 and 3 were measured to be 5± 2% and 6± 2%, respectively, while that for 1 was 0.76 ± 0.03%. given the similarity in hydrophobicity, overall charge, size, shape, and molecular structures of 1 and 3, the fact that their cellular uptake is nearly identical is expected and does not account for the difference in pi values measured for the complexes. the pi values corrected for difference in absorption at 466 nm, picor, results in even greater phototoxicity of 3 relative to that of 1. this result is unexpected, since 1 is able to generate 1o2 in greater yields than 3, but complex 3 may be able to induce dna crosslinks or it may bind to proteins or other biomolecules in the cell following photoinduced ligand exchange. this additional mode of action to 1o2 production may result in the enhanced phototoxicity of 3, with picor = 1,110 ± 206. 14 acs paragon plus environment page 15 of 19 journal of the american chemical

current chemotherapeutic treatments and improve upon current pct agents, complex 3 was synthesized and characterized to function as a multimodal pct complex capable of producing 1o2 and to undergo ligand exchange to potentially covalently bind dna and other biomolecules upon irradiation. the photophysical properties of the new complex were compared to those of 1 and 2, which have been established to undergo efficient 1o2 production and ligand exchange when irradiated, respectively. under analogous conditions, complex 3 produces 1o2 slightly less efficiently than 1 and photoinduced ligand exchange occurs in 3 to a much lesser extent than in 2. it appears, however, that 3 may be a more useful pct agent since its corrected phototoxicty index, picor, is nearly 3 times greater than that of 1. future work includes designing complexes that improve upon the dual efficiency of 1o2 production and ligand exchange, as well as an investigation aimed at gaining further understanding of the mechanism of cell death. 15 acs paragon plus environment journal of the american chemical society page 16 of 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
